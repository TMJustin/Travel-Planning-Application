      <p>This application is a mobile application built in Android Studio. The function of this application is to allow users to submit their own data to keep track of travel plans. These include the ability to add
      destinations, excursions, accommodation details, and start and end dates for the trip. The current build is the MVP for this project and more features can be added and iterated upon.</p>
